<h1>Services</h1>
<p>Each service is an app that is hosted. Services are defined in <code>services/&lt;service-name&gt;</code></p>
<h1>The Reverse HTTP Proxy</h1>
<p>Reverse proxying is accomplished with Caddy, and the corresponding Caddyfile can be found
at <a href="./Caddyfile"><code>Caddyfile</code></a>.</p>
<p>Caddy listens on port <strong>8001</strong> and forwards to each service individually.</p>
<h1>Port multiplexing for SSH</h1>
<p>SSLH is used to multiplex a single port between SSH and HTTP. This is needed
since only a single machine port can be exposed through a tunnel.</p>
<p>SSLH multiplexes port <strong>8000</strong>; the HTTP upstream listens on port <strong>8001</strong> (Caddy), while the
SSH upstream listens on port <strong>22</strong>.</p>
<h1>The Tunnel</h1>
<p>Ngrok provides the tunnel that is used to connect to the WWW. Installation is
via Ngrok's DEB package, nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>Port <strong>80</strong> faces Ngrok's server (the downstream), and <strong>8000</strong> faces SSLH (the upstream).</p>
